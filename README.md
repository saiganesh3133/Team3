This Python-based Data Visualization Dashboard uses Streamlit for interactive data analysis.

Supported File Types
The dashboard only accepts .csv and .xlsx files.
Any other file format will not be processed.
Required Columns
To ensure smooth operation, your dataset must include the following columns:

city
price
availability_365
latitude
longitude
last_review
reviews_per_month
If any of these columns are missing, errors will occur in the dashboard, and the data processing or visualizations will not work correctly.

Important Note
If you want to use a different dataset with other column names or structures, you must modify the code accordingly to handle the new data format.
